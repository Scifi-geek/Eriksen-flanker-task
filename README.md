This Matlab function for the Eriksen Flanker task uses the Psychtoolbox library (psychtoolbox.org) 
to provide highly accurate timing for visual inputs, inputs from the MRI scanner and subject responses. 
The sequence and timing of visual inputs is optimized with genetic algorithms for an optimal sampling of the hemodynamic response (see Kao et al., 2009 for details). 
Adjust the number of dummy scans as well as keycodes of button presses and MRI scanner signal to your individual MRI setup.
